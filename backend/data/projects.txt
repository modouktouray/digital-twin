Digital Twin
• Designed and deployed a production-grade serverless AI Digital Twin of me on AWS, leveraging FastAPI, AWS
Lambda, API Gateway, Bedrock (Nova lite model), S3, and CloudFront to deliver a scalable, low-latency
conversational AI platform.
• Provisioned and managed multi-environment cloud infrastructure using Terraform (IaC), enabling dev/test/prod
isolation with automated setup of IAM, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and CloudFront backed by remote state and
locking.
• Built an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions and OIDC-based AWS authentication, automating
Lambda packaging, infrastructure deployment, frontend builds, S3 publishing, and CloudFront cache
invalidation.

Dialogue Summarization (AWS SageMaker + Flan-T5)
• Fine-tuned the Flan-T5 model using PEFT/LoRA in SageMaker Notebooks.
• Evaluated summarization quality using ROUGE metrics.
• Produced a lightweight, cost-efficient model for conversation summarization

Farm Intrusion Detection System
• Led full-cycle development of a real-time intrusion detection system for farmers.
• Conducted data pre-processing and applied augmentation using OpenCV to simulate nighttime conditions
across 75% of the dataset.
• Trained a deep learning model using Transfer Learning (InceptionV3) with hyperparameter tuning and iterative
experimentation, achieving 98% accuracy on the final model.
• Deployed a lightweight detection pipeline with Streamlit and integrated Twilio for instant SMS alerts to farmers.

AI-Driven E-Commerce Customer Support Agent
• Architected and deployed a Node.js e-commerce platform using AWS, GCP, and Azure for scalable, intelligent
operations.
• Automated secure AWS infrastructure with Terraform (VPC, Lambda, DynamoDB) for repeatable, productionready
deployments.
• Containerized and orchestrated workloads using Docker and Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) for high availability and
portability.
• Built a full CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline, enabling automated build, test, and zero-downtime releases.
• Designed and optimized an AI-powered customer support agent using AWS Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 3 and
GPT-4) to securely query DynamoDB, generate accurate insights, and deliver personalized customer responses.
• Implemented a real-time, event-driven data pipeline by streaming DynamoDB updates through Lambda into
Google BigQuery, enabling analytics and reporting on order data.
• Integrated Azure AI Language for sentiment analysis to enhance customer experience by detecting user intent
and emotional context during agent interactions.

Spam Classification System
• Led and built a complete NLP pipeline for spam detection.
• Developed a script to automate the data extraction pipeline to parse raw emails from the Enron corpus’s multifolder
directory structure and transform them into a structured CSV dataset.
• Engineered an end-to-end preprocessing workflow, including text cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal.
• Applied TF-IDF vectorization to transform text into numerical features optimised for Logistic Regression.
• Achieved 98% accuracy, 97% precision, and 99% recall, representing a 43% improvement over baseline.


MediNotes Pro
• Developed and deployed an AI-powered full-stack SaaS application on AWS, delivering a scalable, cloud-native
solution.
• Built a Next.js + React frontend and a high-performance FastAPI backend, ensuring fast, reliable user
interactions.
• Containerized the application with Docker and implemented a clean deployment workflow using Amazon ECR,
App Runner, and CloudWatch for monitoring and operational stability.
• Set up image tagging, versioning, and automated pushes to ECR to support traceable, rollback-friendly
deployments.
• Implemented secure user authentication with Clerk and configured environment secrets and OpenAI API keys
following best practices.
